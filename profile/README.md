# IW-Academy Org

This is the InfinityWorks internal Academy organisation.

In here we have:

- Personal learning repositories of the current and recent Academites. We eventually clean out "old" ones after about 3-6 months.
- All _Team_ Projects that the Academites have produced, held over all time for posterity.
